### ✅ 9. Build and Deployment Preparation
- Successfully built project with `npm run build`
- Fixed all import and dependency issues
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation
- Generated Vercel deployment guide

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** for components
- **RainbowKit** for wallet integration
- **Wagmi** for Web3 interactions

### Smart Contract Stack
- **Solidity ^0.8.24**
- **FHEVM** for homomorphic encryption
- **Sepolia testnet** deployment ready
- **FHE-encrypted** sensitive data

### Key Features
1. **Private Bond Trading**: All sensitive data encrypted with FHE
2. **Wallet Integration**: Seamless Web3 wallet connection
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Selective disclosure capabilities
4. **Real-time Analytics**: Market data and portfolio tracking
5. **Security**: Industry-standard encryption and access controls

## Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/b18fb7e6ca7045ac83c41157ab93f990
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=2ec9743d0d0cd7fb94dee1a7e6d33475
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=b18fb7e6ca7045ac83c41157ab93f990
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Vercel Deployment
1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy automatically on push to main
4. Monitor build logs and performance

### Manual Deployment
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data encrypted with FHE technology
- Smart contracts implement zero-knowledge proofs
- Wallet integration uses industry-standard practices
- Regular security audits recommended

## Next Steps

1. **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploy FHE contracts to Sepolia testnet
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of wallet integration and FHE operations
3. **UI Enhancement**: Add more trading features and analytics
4. **Documentation**: Expand user guides and API documentation
5. **Security Audit**: Professional security review of smart contracts
